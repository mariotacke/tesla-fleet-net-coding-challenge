# Tesla Fleet Net Coding Challenge
Our team is responsible for delivering over-the-air software updates to vehicles. We consider each attempt to update software on a vehicle to a new version a Job. As the vehicle progresses through the process of updating, it sends updates to our server, which we call JobStatuses. In addition, we group Jobs together into Rollouts.

Your task is to write a program that will accept a series of requests that both update the Rollout/Job/JobStatus space and query it.
